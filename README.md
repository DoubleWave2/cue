# (RA-L) Uncertainty Estimation for 3D Dense Prediction via Cross-Point Embeddings

![CUE demo](./CUE.gif)

We have named our proposed method CUE and demonstrated it in two tasks, 3D gemetric feature learning and 3D semantic segmentation. We organize the code in two directories to make it more readable:

- CUE on 3D gemetric feature learning: ðŸ‘‰ [CUE Feature](cue_feature/README.md)

- CUE on 3D semantic segmentation: ðŸ‘‰ [CUE Segmentation](cue_segmentation/README.md)
